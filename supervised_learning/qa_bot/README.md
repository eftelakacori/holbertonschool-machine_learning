Question-Answering (QA): Question-Answering is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves developing systems or models capable of understanding and responding to questions posed in human language. QA systems take a question as input and provide a relevant answer by extracting information from a given dataset or knowledge base. QA can be categorized into two main types:

Extractive QA: These systems extract answers directly from a predefined set of documents or passages. The answer is typically a span of text from the source documents.
Generative QA: In generative QA, the system generates answers in natural language, often requiring a deeper understanding of the context and the ability to generate coherent responses.
Semantic Search: Semantic search is a search technique that aims to improve the relevance and accuracy of search results by understanding the meaning or semantics of the query and the documents being searched. Traditional keyword-based search relies on matching exact words or phrases, whereas semantic search takes into account the context, synonyms, related concepts, and the overall meaning of the query to provide more relevant results.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): BERT is a pre-trained language model developed by Google's AI researchers. It belongs to the transformer architecture family and is specifically designed for understanding context and semantics in natural language. BERT is trained on a massive corpus of text data and can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks, including question-answering, text classification, and sentiment analysis. BERT has been influential in achieving state-of-the-art results in various NLP benchmarks.
