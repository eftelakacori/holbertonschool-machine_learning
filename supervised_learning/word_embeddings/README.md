Word embeddings are a type of word representation used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning tasks. They are numerical vector representations of words in a continuous vector space. The main idea behind word embeddings is to map words into a multi-dimensional space where similar words are located close to each other based on their semantic meaning or context.

Word embeddings have become popular because they offer several advantages over traditional sparse representations (e.g., one-hot encoding or bag-of-words). Some of the key characteristics of word embeddings are:

Dense representations: Unlike sparse representations where most elements are zero, word embeddings are dense vectors, meaning they contain real-valued elements that capture semantic relationships between words.

Semantic meaning: Word embeddings are learned in such a way that words with similar meanings or that appear in similar contexts are represented close to each other in the vector space.

Contextual information: Some word embedding models, like ELMo and BERT, offer contextual embeddings, where the representation of a word varies depending on the context it appears in.

Word embeddings are used as input features in various NLP tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition, and more. They help in capturing the semantic relationships between words and contribute to better performance in downstream NLP applications by providing more meaningful and compact representations of words.
